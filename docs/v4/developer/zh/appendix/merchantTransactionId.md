## merchantTransactionId
merchantTransactionId usually refers to a merchant transaction identifier, which is a string or number used to uniquely identify a merchant's transaction. In many systems and scenarios, merchantTransactionId may also be referred to as a merchant order number, merchant transaction ID, etc.

Similar to transactionId, the purpose of merchantTransactionId is to ensure that each merchant transaction has a unique identifier so that the system can accurately track and manage each transaction. On e-commerce websites, when merchants receive customer orders, they can generate a unique merchantTransactionId in their own way. This allows merchants to use merchantTransactionId to track the status of orders and ensure that orders are processed correctly.

In payment systems, merchants often need to provide their merchantTransactionId to the payment service provider for payment processing. This identifier is usually associated with the transactionId generated by the payment service provider and can help merchants track and confirm the status of payments."
