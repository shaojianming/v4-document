<Common-Recommend></Common-Recommend>

### Hosted-Redirect 
If you want to spend the least amount of technical effort running your checkout pages on your website, try redirecting customers to the PingPongCheckOut hosted pages so you can focus on what matters to you. We take care of the entire payment process.

### Hosted-JS-SDK

If you want to display a unified payment method list to customers at checkout while still customizing the appearance of certain pages, try integrating our JS SDK without extensive front-end development work.
### Non-Hosted

If you want full control over the appearance of your checkout pages and want your customers to pay through your user interface, try processing transactions by directly using our API building on the backend. Note that this option requires more time and development resources to implement and maintain.
