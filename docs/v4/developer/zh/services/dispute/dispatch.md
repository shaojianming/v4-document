When a cardholder is unable to recognize a transaction on their statement, they usually request a copy of the documentation related to the transaction from their issuing bank in order to determine if it was authorized by them. Merchants are required to submit a copy of the transaction documentation to the acquiring institution, which will then be forwarded to the issuing bank.
